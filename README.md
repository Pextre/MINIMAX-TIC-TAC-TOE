# MINIMAX-TIC-TAC-TOE

## This project was made with the intention to learn how the minimax algorithm works and to implement it.
I followed the  pseudocode from [wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). It is a really interesting algorithm, works around an assumption that the opponent(you) plays the best move. The algorithm will run over all the possibilities of the game and return the max value it beign 1=X , 0=TIE , -1=O. Since it start playing the human has no chance of winning.

You could try to defeat it but I bet that you can't ;D .

### Here is it working !
